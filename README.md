This notebook is my one of my attempt to study the dataset, nit picking the features and predict the outcome using **Logistic Regression Model** and **Random Forests** along account of taking various **random states** in considerations.

### Why  I chose Logistic Reg? 
Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution. Thus, it treats the same set of problems as probit regression using similar techniques, with the latter using a cumulative normal distribution curve instead. Equivalently, in the latent variable interpretations of these two methods, the first assumes a standard logistic distribution of errors and the second a standard normal distribution of errors.
